# The Matrix: A Cybersecurity Standards Mapping

*Repository : [Senior Project] (https://github.com/maa0110/Senior-Project)*

![alt text](https://github.com/maa0110/Portfolio/blob/main/Crossmapping%20Meme.png)

####  **Description:**

> My project is a research project that analyzes cybersecurity standard compliance practices. The goal of the project is to optimize the compliance process through a multi-standard crossmapping analysis.   I hope that through my project, I am also able to help others get familiar with cybersecurity standards and practices. The project was completed in 2 phases: learning, and implementing.  During the learning phase I learned the material on the NERC CIPs, the NIST Framework, and the CIS Controls.  After I had successfully researched the standards I built an Excel document where I implemented a cross-mapping analysis of the three standards and built an implementation tracker.  

#### **Reflection:**

> This program showed my ability to apply critical thinking skills in learning and summarizing highlevel information. I also learned the concepts required for software development like agile development when releasing the excel book in different release versions. I gained the experience of working in an individual setting and developing effective problem-solving skills while working through implementations of the tool. At the end of my project, my global responsibility and communication skills were illustrated in the professional and easily understandable quality of my project.

# ToDo List:

*Repository : [ToDo List] (https://github.com/maa0110/Linux-Project)*

####  **Description:**

>The Linux project is a computer-based activity tracker. The goal of the project is to help users track their tasks in a “to-do list.” The hope is that this would allow users to be more productive and aware of everything they needed to do. The program allows users to create new tasks, mark the completion status, and view both the completed and uncompleted tasks.

#### **Reflection:**

>This is the first shell program that I have written. This program shows my ability to learn new programing languages and attain a system-level understanding of my computer through my Shell programing. At this point I had almost no background in software development techniques. Everything was coded from scratch allowing me to develop my problem-solving skills as I encountered errors along the way. I acquired significant project experience in working in a group setting and working with others’ code.

# Chatroom:

*Repository : [Chatroom] (https://github.com/neem-41/chatroom)*

####  **Description:**

>The Chatroom project is a computer-based client and server that allows users to send messages to each other. The goal of the project was to facilitate communication between friends, classmates, etc. The hope of our program was that by following a protocol created together as a class would allow for other teams’ clients to work with our server and vice versa. Users will start up the server and then the client and join the server. Once in the server users can see the other online usernames and can broadcast messages to everyone in the chatroom. Users can also choose to send private direct messages to each other. Once the user is satisfied with their communications, they can press the exit button, leaving the server. Once a user leaves, the other users’ clients update and no longer show the user as well as no longer broadcasting messages to their connection.

#### **Reflection:**

>This is one of the first client-server-based programs that I have written. This program shows my ability to learn client server connections and designing programs from protocols. We used Java for this program and used the sockets and serverSockets libraries. We implemented the concepts of software development when releasing our chatroom in different releases. We used our critical thinking skills to problem solve errors in our client and server communication throughout the project process. I earned significance experience in working in a group setting and interacting with code written by two different people as we each initially focused on the client or the server.

# Number Ninja

![alt text](https://github.com/maa0110/Portfolio/blob/main/Screen%20Shot%202022-04-29%20at%206.00.11%20PM.png)

####  **Description:**

Number Ninja is a fun-filled 2D platformer built to educate the age groups 6-7+ on basic math such as addition, subtraction,  and number recognition (ones, tens, and hundredth place). Students will be following the story of a parkour skilled ninja  named Tau as he navigates through obstacles and hardships, more specifically high risk jumps, stunts, etc. Students will be  the determining factor for Tau’s wellbeing and have to answer mathematical questions within a certain amount of time or else Tau’s mission will fail.


#### **Reflection:**

This program was my first time using unity to code and build a game.  I was able to earn great experience in a group setting and interacting with code written by different people all on the same project.  This project was very fun as we were able to be as creative as we wanted in designing and building the game.  Unity however was difficult at times and took a lot of my critical thinking skills to find my way out of messes in the program.  It was great being able to take some global responsibility and make a game to help children learn math!

# Cybersecurity in Infrastructure Protection

*Repository : [Cybersecurity in Infrastructure Protection] (https://github.com/maa0110/Computer-Security-Presentation)*

![alt text](https://github.com/maa0110/Portfolio/blob/main/critical%20infrastructure.png)

####  **Description:**

This is a presentation I gave for the final in my computer security class.  The presentation covers the importance of defending our critical infrastructure from cyber threats.  It goes in depth explaining the different critical infrastructures, threats we face, historical attacks, and threat prevention.

#### **Reflection:**

I enjoyed doing this project as I enjoy cybersecurity work and am starting a career in the field.  The presentation allowed me to work on my proffesional creativity and communication in making sure my information was interesting and concise.  The project allowed me to collobrate with others and share my passion with them.
