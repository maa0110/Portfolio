# The Matrix: A Cybersecurity Standards Mapping

<br>

*Repository : [Senior Project] (https://github.com/maa0110/Senior-Project)*

<br>

> My project is a research project that analyzes cybersecurity standard compliance practices. The
goal of the project is to optimize the compliance process by compiling my research and creating
an efficiency tool in Microsoft Excel. I hope that through my project, I am also able to help
others get familiar with cybersecurity standards and practices. The general idea of the project
is that afterwards there will be a tool that is an amalgamation of my research with added
functionality to allow users to conduct and track their own compliancy processes. Users will be
able to look at the standards’ publications as well as view a simplified summary of information
alongside standards’ cross mappings. The users will then be able to enter their own
information and track their compliancy process. Checklists and summary sheets will allow users
to see how close they are and what is left on the road to compliancy. Once they are compliant,
they will be able to track audit resources in the document, allowing the information to all be
stored/linked in one place.

> This program shows my ability to apply critical thinking skills in learning and summarizing highlevel
information. I will learn the concepts required for software development like agile
development when releasing the efficiency tool in different release versions. I will gain the
experience of working in an individual setting and developing effective problem-solving skills
while working through implementations of the tool. At the end of my project, my global
responsibility and communication skills will be illustrated in the professional and easily
understandable quality of my project as I present it to the school.

# ToDo List:

<br>

*Repository : [ToDo List] (https://github.com/maa0110/Linux-Project)*

<br>

>The Linux project is a computer-based activity tracker. The goal of the project is to help users
track their tasks in a “to-do list.” The hope is that this would allow users to be more productive
and aware of everything they needed to do. The program allows users to create new tasks,
mark the completion status, and view both the completed and uncompleted tasks.

<br>

>This is the first shell program that I have written. This program shows my ability to learn new
programing languages and attain a system-level understanding of my computer through my
Shell programing. At this point I had almost no background in software development
techniques. Everything was coded from scratch allowing me to develop my problem-solving
skills as I encountered errors along the way. I acquired significant project experience in working
in a group setting and working with others’ code.

<br>

# Chatroom:

<br>

*Repository : [Chatroom] (https://github.com/neem-41/chatroom)*

<br>

>The Chatroom project is a computer-based client and server that allows users to send messages
to each other. The goal of the project was to facilitate communication between friends,
classmates, etc. The hope of our program was that by following a protocol created together as
a class would allow for other teams’ clients to work with our server and vice versa. Users will
start up the server and then the client and join the server. Once in the server users can see the
other online usernames and can broadcast messages to everyone in the chatroom. Users can
also choose to send private direct messages to each other. Once the user is satisfied with their
communications, they can press the exit button, leaving the server. Once a user leaves, the
other users’ clients update and no longer show the user as well as no longer broadcasting
messages to their connection.

<br>

>This is one of the first client-server-based programs that I have written. This program shows my
ability to learn client server connections and designing programs from protocols. We used Java
for this program and used the sockets and serverSockets libraries. We implemented the
concepts of software development when releasing our chatroom in different releases. We used
our critical thinking skills to problem solve errors in our client and server communication
throughout the project process. I earned significance experience in working in a group setting
and interacting with code written by two different people as we each initially focused on the
client or the server.
